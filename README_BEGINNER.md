Don't worry! You don't need to be a carrom expert to create an amazing ML bot. Here are several proven strategies:

# - "World Carrom Federation"
# - "Pro Carrom Players"
```

### Step 2: Analyze Expert Videos
```bash
# Process expert gameplay video
python3 main.py --mode expert --video expert_gameplay.mp4 --debug

# The bot will:
# 1. Extract game states from video
# 2. Analyze expert strategies
# 3. Generate training data
# 4. Train the model automatically
```

### Step 3: Results
- ✅ Bot learns professional strategies
- ✅ No carrom skills required from you

## Strategy 2: Rule-Based Foundation + Learning

### Built-in Expert Strategies
The bot includes pre-programmed expert strategies:

```python
# These strategies are already built-in:
# 1. Opening game: Conservative center shots
# 2. Mid-game: Aggressive positioning
# 3. End-game: Precise calculated shots
```

### How to Use:
```bash
# Start with rule-based play (no training needed)
python3 main.py --mode play --episodes 5 --debug

# The bot will use built-in expert strategies
# and gradually learn from its own experience
```

## Strategy 3: Copy Successful Players Online

### Record Live Gameplay
1. **Find online tournaments/streams**:
   - Twitch carrom streams
   - YouTube live tournaments
   - Mobile game replays

2. **Screen record expert matches**:
```bash
# Use screen recording software to capture expert games
# Then analyze with the bot:
python3 main.py --mode expert --video recorded_tournament.mp4
```

## Strategy 4: AI vs AI Learning

### Let the Bot Teach Itself
```bash
# Start with random play and let it evolve
python3 main.py --mode train --episodes 200 --debug

# The bot will:
# 1. Start with random moves
# 2. Learn which moves work
# 3. Gradually improve strategy
# 4. Develop its own style
```

## Strategy 5: Incremental Learning (Recommended for Beginners)

### Phase 1: Basic Rules (Week 1)
```bash
# Learn basic game rules through observation
python3 main.py --mode collect --episodes 20 --debug

# Just watch the bot observe games
# No skill required from you
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Week 2)
```bash
# Let the bot identify winning patterns
python3 main.py --mode train --episodes 100 --debug
```

### Phase 3: Strategy Development (Week 3+)
```bash
# Bot develops advanced strategies
python3 main.py --mode play --episodes 50 --debug
```

## Quick Setup for Complete Beginners

# Download this sample expert video (replace with real video)
# Then run:
python3 main.py --mode expert --video expert_sample.mp4 --episodes 50 --debug
```

### 2. Automated Improvement
```bash
# Set up automatic daily training
# Add this to your crontab:
# 0 2 * * * cd /path/to/carrom && python3 main.py --mode train --episodes 10
```
